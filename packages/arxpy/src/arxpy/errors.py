title: Public exception hierarchy for the ArxPy API.
summary: >-
  Define the single error hierarchy ArxPy raises to callers: ArxError as the
  base, with ParseError, CompileError, and ExecutionError for the lex/parse,
  analysis/lowering, and execution stages of the pipeline. Each error carries a
  list of structured Diagnostic records so callers can inspect failures
  programmatically instead of scraping message text. The pipeline modules catch
  upstream arx and irx exceptions and re-raise them as these types, building
  diagnostics via the helpers in arxpy.diagnostics.
